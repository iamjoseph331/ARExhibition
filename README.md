# ARExhibition
Project for MHCI at NTU. It's an AR application that uses QR codes to show models that can then be interacted with, either by a single person or a group.

# Engine:
The application is powered by Unity3D, its binary files can be found in the bin folder

# USAGE:
The Project contains two scenes, one for the tourist, and one for the tour guide. Using the tourist mode, the tour guide can scan the QRcode, import the model by pressing the import button, and sync the model to the tourists. The guide can then rotate or shift the model, and the tourist side will have the same outcome.

To use the touist mode, create a room via bluetooth on the upper right corner of the app.
If you are not using the tourist mode, simply scan the QrCode and import the model for your heart's content.
